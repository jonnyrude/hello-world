  * What new skills have you learned?
	
	I knew most things about HTML before, so I actually learned most about Slack and the forum. I enjoyed engaging with the community the most so far.
  
* What has been easy?
	
	I thought the challenges were pretty easy, because I had experience with these elements before. I was delighted to learn how easy it was to interact with others on slack and the forum.
  * What has been difficult?

	I was a bit intimidated to start, so getting engaged was the toughest. The figure element through me a little too.

  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome 
challenges so far?

	I haven't run into too many problems yet, but I've really enjoyed helping others in the community with theirs.
