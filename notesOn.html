    <!-- No closing tag
          alt text and file names for images are used by search engines,
          alt="" - leave blank for decorative images, b/c it is read by screen readers and annoying
          CSS  background-image: url("#")  should be used for decorative images, since they have no semantic meaning
          alt text should briefly convey any info conained in the image
          alt text can be link text, if not in the link title= attribute
          images shouldn't be text-only (like headers, titles with shadows, etc.) unless unavoidable
          width= & height= attributes OK - leaves space for image during loading or if unable to load
          title= attribut OK, but not necc - displays only when mouse hovers - useful when captions aren't an option
          SVG file - (vector graphic) has no inherent aspect ratio, so def use width & height attributes-->

        <!-- This is what is used to insert YouTube videos and other "documents" into your site
            SOURCE - set the source with Javascript, so the video LOADS LAST, since that can slow the overal loading of the page
        ALWAYS USE sandbox attribute - prevents the iframe code from effecting any other code on the page - for sercurity in modern browsers
            Do not use to embed in anything http - only the secure httpS -->
